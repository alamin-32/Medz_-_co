                <h2 className='text-2xl font-semibold'><span className='text-3xl font-bold'>Q:</span> How does prototypical inheritance work?</h2>
                <p className='text-xl font-bold mt-1'>Answer: <small>. The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf. Nowadays, in modern language, it is being set using __proto__.</small></p>

                <p className='text-xl font-bold mt-1'>Answer: <small>Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure.</small></p>
